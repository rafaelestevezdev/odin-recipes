                <li>1/4 teaspoon saffron threads</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl, soak the saffron threads in a little warm stock to release the color and flavor.</li>
                <li>In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the Arborio rice to the pan and stir to coat each grain in the butter and oil. Cook for 2-3 minutes, allowing the rice to lightly toast.</li>
                <li>Pour in the white wine and stir until it's mostly absorbed.</li>
                <li>Begin adding the warm stock, one ladleful at a time, stirring constantly and waiting for the liquid to be absorbed before adding more stock. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked to your desired texture (about 18-20 minutes).</li>
                <li>Once the rice is cooked, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the remaining butter and grated Parmesan cheese. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately, garnished with extra Parmesan if desired.</li>
            </ol>
